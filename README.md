# Gazebo
This program allows guests to text a Spotify song link to a Twilio number to get that song added to the queue of the user running the program. I made this so that when I was entertaining at my house, people could request songs without them having to ask me and then me having to go to the app, search the song, and add it to the queue.

## Dependancies
This app uses Flask, the Twilio module, and the Spotipy module.
I also used Ngrok to tunnel the Webhooks from Twilio to my Local Host.
